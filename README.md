# Real-Id-for-Skyrim-Wiki
Replaces partial Form IDs, at Skyrim Wikis, by their real Dawnguard/Hearthfire/Dragonborn Form IDs, so you can copy them easily. Partial Form IDs are outdated in this case because DLC load order is enforced for Special/Anniversary Edition.
## Install
### [Click to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsHel/Real-Id-for-Skyrim-Wiki-Userscript/main/Real-Id-for-Skyrim-Wiki.user.js)
In order to use this you need [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) or similar userscript manager.
## Notes
- Works for https://en.uesp.net/wiki and https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki
- I wasn't able to replace all Form IDs, but I would say it works for like 99%
