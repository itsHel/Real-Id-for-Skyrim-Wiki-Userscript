# Real-Id-for-Skyrim-Wiki
Replaces partial Form IDs, at Skyrim Wikis, by their real Dawnguard/Hearthfire/Dragonborn Form IDs.
## Install
### [Click to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsHel/Real-Id-for-Skyrim-Wiki-Userscript/main/Real-Id-for-Skyrim-Wiki.user.js)
In order to use this you need [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or similar userscript manager.
## Information
- Works for https://en.uesp.net/wiki and https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki
- Some Form IDs are ignored
- Not planning on doing this for AE as I don't think it has enforced load order
